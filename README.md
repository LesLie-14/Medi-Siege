## Game Overview 
Medi-Siege is an educational tower defense game based on the human immune system. The game aims to educate users about how the body defends itself in a fun and accessible way. We are using the Unity game engine to build this 2D tower defense game. Even though there are many other educational games out there, none of those are teaching how our body is fighting against bacterias and viruses as accurately and engaging as our game.

## Game Play Mechanics	
The players will be in charge of protecting the human body by effectively distributing the white blood cells. Players can protect the host by placing the white blood cells in the appropriate areas that act like a tower that attacks the foreign pathogens.

## Game World 
Each level of our game will take place in different parts of the human body. The objective of the player is to survive the infection by destroying the infectious pathogens moving around the blood vessels. The players will be able to destroy these pathogens by effectively distributing the white blood cells for producing antibodies that our immune system uses to defend against foreign pathogens

## Characters
**White Blood Cells**
There are various types of white blood cells provided in each level of the game. The white blood cells can be placed in tower areas colored in brown to defend against foreign pathogens. Once the white blood cells are placed, these will attack pathogens moving around the blood vessels, when they are in range.

## Enemies
**Pathogens**
Pathogens are infectious foreign elements that enter into the human body and can produce diseases. Pathogens are moving around the human body through blood vessels. In the game players can see pathogens moving through blood vessels and can be destroyed by placing the right white blood cells in the appropriate tower areas.
